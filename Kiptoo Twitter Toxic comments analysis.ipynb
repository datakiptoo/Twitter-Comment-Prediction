Project Background and Aim.\n","Twitter is social network platform where people have interaction and discussion about several issues affecting the society. It is a great platform to share and get information about what is going on around the globe. A platform with global reach comes with the problem of people using toxic and obscene language with the intention of abusing people hence a good platform is destroyed by a few bad apples. This project is aimed at recognizing obscene and toxic tweets using NLP and machine learning techniques.
